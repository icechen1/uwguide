# Canadian Taxes
Canadian taxes are due by April 30. You generally will need to file Canadian taxes even if you have not worked in the country in the last year.

For most students, there are two components to your Canadian taxes, wage income and education tax credits. You will need to report your T4s (or foreign income, if you worked in the US), and the educational tax credit 

Luckily, you can import your tax slips directly from the Canadian Revenue Agency for most tax software, which should load up and prefill your T4 and T2202A forms for you. To do this you will need to have a CRA account registered beforehand, though.

There are many options to file your taxes online. I personally use [UFile](https://www.ufile.ca/), which handles both Canadian and Quebec taxes. As a undergraduate student you can get UFile for free using the code [here](https://cfs-fcee.ca/services/).


# American Taxes
American taxes are due by April 15. You will need to file both Federal and State taxes if you worked in the US. Before you file these taxes, you will need to have:
*  W-2 forms from all your employers in the tax year -- these should come in by January 31 each year.

## Federal
Welcome to the dark ages,

## State
Instructions on how to file taxes depend on which state you have worked in.

### California
You cannot e-file your state taxes yet. You will need to file form 540NR.

### New York
You will need to file forms IT2, IT 203, IT 203b. Unfortunately as far as I know it is not possible to file taxes electronically for New York, so you will have to mail it out.

### Washington
You don't need to file state taxes as there is no income tax here! Lucky you.
