<!-- SUBTITLE: Fantastic Waterloo Gems and Where to Find Them -->

# Welcome

We want to create a guide that includes some useful info for campus life (Counseling! Secret tunnels on campus! Grad House beers!), but also information on interesting things to do around the campus. One thing I noticed when talking to first years is that a good amount of them haven’t left the area around the campus all that much. Hopefully, by listing things in the city, we can dispel the myth that there is nothing to do in the KW area… it won’t be Toronto, or NYC, for sure, but we’ve got to start somewhere :)
