* **Death Valley’s Little Brother**

DVLB is my favorite place to go. Abbreviated from Death Valley’s Little Brother, they’re a coffee and scotch bar. They have a nice vibe (rustic, old timey, lot of wood), and there’a an upright piano inside the cafe that people will sometimes play. Coffee is good. They’re a general goto, you can go there to study, chill out, or on a date. They do tea as well, but I’ve never tried it.


*  **Settlement Co (Downtown Kitchener and Uptown Waterloo)**

Settlement Co. is across the street a few blocks down on King street. I like their Mocha, they put real dark chocolate in it. The coffee is good, but it’s more of a study space for me. People do go here on dates, but it can get a little crowded. Definitely wouldn’t go here to hangout with friends.

*  **BRCH (pronounced “Birch”)**, is locates at 1 King North. It used to be a coworking space, and has been repurposed into a super modern style cafe. They do lots of quirky fruity coffee drinks and lots of iced coffees (there’s one with guava and strawberry if I remember correctly). I think they also charge their menu every once in a while based on what’s available. They have a super open space, and it’s really nice to hangout. Definitely worth checking out!

Settlement for the coffee and studying, BRCH to hangout and for quirky drinks, DVLB anytime, for anything.
