<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Clubs -->

* [**Acapella**](https://www.facebook.com/UWACC/)**:** Very friendly group of people and you usually go out for food after rehearsals so there’s bonding time! ACE is the open group; the rest are auditioned.

* [**Campus Crusade for Cheese**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2202862856&ref=br_rs): Super laid back group: come for the cheese, stay for the people. Look for cheese related events like grilled cheese & cheesecake nights and for some reason karaoke! 

* [**Hip Hop Club**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uwaterloohiphop/about/): A performance team you can join (no audition) and weekly dance tutorials. It’s a super supportive environment and people are super friendly!

* [**Limelight Dance Crew**](https://www.facebook.com/limelightdancecrew/): Kpop dance lessons on Friday nights.

* [**Sallsa/Buchata**](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003660543951): Good if you want to exercise in a fun way and meet some people outside your faculty!

* [**Archery**](https://www.facebook.com/uwarchery/): They have bows and arrows for you if you don’t have your own (better if you do), $25 for the term and they have weekly practices.

* [**Outers Club**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/UWoutersclub/): $10 membership a term for very cheap camping gear rentals, about $10/person for a weekend for 4 people)

* [**UW Hiking Club**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/126752278049600/): if you’re feeling outdoorsy and you wanna explore Waterloo!
