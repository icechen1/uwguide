<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Study Areas -->

* **Environment 1 ** has a covered courtyard with tables and outlets - pretty nice place when the weather is alright that usually isn’t that busy 

* **Optometry ** has spacious and well lit areas

* **Hagey Hall Hub (New HH / H3)** is also a great place! Lots of space and the tables have chargers for your laptop. You can find large round study tables in the back for group work, some comfy couches, and smaller round tables for independent work (be advised: not a quiet study area)

* **BMH **has tables against the wall which are nice since there’s nothing in front of you to distract you, but be forewarned there are many people passing through

* Between **TC and DP** is a great place to read/relax outdoors.

* You can request rooms to study at **TC** when interviews are not happening.

* **MC 3rd floor Balcony** is relatively good too… compared to the rest of MC, it’s a good place to study or work between MC classes and you can get some fresh air

* **MC 5th and 6th floor** has some spaces with power and it is renovated and looks nicer than the rest of MC.

* **DP **basement has some comfy couches.

* **E6 5th floor** has a lot of tables with power. Not super crowded and relatively close to Philips/Lester student housing

* **St Jerome’s new building (SJ2) **has a very open, naturally-lit layout with workspaces overlooking the creek

* **SLC 3rd floor **quiet study (when renovations finally finish)

* **M3 **on each floor has a small section by the stairwell where you can sit at a table, there’s a chalkboard you can write on, and a big open window with a nice view

* Any new building on campus: E5, QNC, STC

* **Conrad Grebel Milton Good Library: **Nice tables and natural light.
