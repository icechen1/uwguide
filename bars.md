Pin Up Bar: Laurier Plaza

Chainsaw

Abe Erb - good beers, one of the better ones in the area with a great variety. Flight is a good option to get a taste of multiple ones - though food is a bit on the rich side.

Beertown - a firm favourite for end of term class dinners. Also a great place to get a wide variety of beer from around the world, pretty good food (the slow cooked pork is amazing but can be heavy for some) and catch whatever hockey game that is playing (Leafs games or Toronto Marlies games typically get the big screen)

Duke of Wellington

Bobby O'Brians - has a great outdoor patio

Becky’s Apartment - small, but a wild time

Huether Hotel - Cool outdoor patio (technically called Barley Works, I think)

McCabe's

**Kickoff**: UW Plaza. "You can bring any food you want in there, and drink beer. Don’t ask for food there."

Molly Blooms

Phil's Grandson's Place (Club) - get ready for your shoes to stick to the ground

**Pub on King: **Uptown Waterloo. Cheap beer. Has a good fish & chips deal

Stark and Peri's - nice outdoor patio
