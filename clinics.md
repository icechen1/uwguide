<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Clinics -->

I recommend the Westmount Place Clinic. Weekday mornings are the best time to go, they aren't very busy so the wait time is pretty short. The clinic on campus I believe only takes walk-in if they are urgent. For appointments, they usually make you wait a week, and in my experience, appointments are almost impossible to make over the phone (extremely long wait times).

For students looking for a family doctor, I know that The Boardwalk Medical Clinic is taking new patients. I haven't been there personally, but I've heard good things.
UW Health Service also has a family clinic for family doctors
