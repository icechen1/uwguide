# On Campus

* **Grad House:** $10 Wellington pitchers after 4:30 PM and a $7 special daily

* **The Bombshelter Pub:** Bomber Breakfast (eggs, toast, home fries, meat) is $4 before 11 AM. Add $1 for 2 pancakes or a drink. Daily specials. Friday Wings half price.

# Around Campus/University

* **Morals Village**: expensive but great. They have a noodle option that’s a la carte if you don’t want to pay for the expensive hot pot though the hot pot (dat lamb) is quite good.

* **Asakusa**: a bit on the pricier side but debatably much better than Kenzo’s for ramen. Atmosphere is also nice and isn’t too cramped.

* **Ken’s Sushi**: The only decent sushi place near campus. Also pricy for the quality but if you want a fix of fish it’s the fastest way. On a good day you’ll get the salmon fresh and it’ll actually be worth the money… Lunch specials are decently priced.

* **Gol’s Lanzhou Noodle**: Quality food with good portion size ($10-15).

* **Kenzo Ramen**: Really good ramen! A solid lunch meal, and pretty reasonably priced (~$10)

* **Waterloo Star**: Pretty cheap, decent asian food (especially if you go for their lunch specials which is like 6.99 (includes a dish as well as soup and all you can drink pop)

* **Poke Box (King/University)**: Comparatively pretty worthwhile for the money. The dressing and heaping of avocado is something to yearn for.

* **Morty’s Pub (King/University)**: Monday/Thursday $9/lb wing nights with a drink. 

* **The China Bowl (King/University)**: Decent asian food, but bring a group since it’s family style. Their quality has gotten worse over time, look forward to the new places opening up around the Mel’s plaza.

* **Bhima's Warung (King/University)**: a bit expensive, but fantastic food and atmosphere. Very relaxed.

# Reasonably Bussable

* [**Berlin Bicycle Cafe**](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/berlin-bicycle-cafe-kitchener): a hidden gem that I’m finally revealing. Super cute theme of bicycles and coffee. Located on Belmont which looks like a tiny main street full of people in the summer. 

* [**Famoso's**](https://famoso.ca/) (Uptown Waterloo): Wholesome italian restaurant with really good pizzas and pasta. A nicer place, so it is a bit more expensive (~$20/meal). 

* [**Owl of Minerva**](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-famous-owl-of-minerva-waterloo)  (Uptown Waterloo): Best Korean in Waterloo ($10-15)

* **Vincenzo’s**  (South of Uptown): GOD TIER, both for super high quality groceries at weirdly reasonable prices, and for good reasonably priced sandwiches.

* **Flame Meat Shop (North of campus):** Probably the best indian food in waterloo per dollar. Pretty difficult to get to, and the food takes ~30-45 min to prep b/c they only make orders fresh, and you’ll have to bus/uber/drive there to pick it up. You can get 3 meat + 3 veg curries + 3 boxes of rice + 3 naan as a student deal for a very reasonable price, definitely worth it if you have a lot of friends who are craving south asian food where Aunty’s won’t cut it.

* **My-Thai**: one of the more authentic thai curries I’ve had in awhile, but only been once so it’s hard to say if it was a fluke.

* **Bauer Kitchen**: more on the expensive side, but really great for bringing people who you want to impress - be it recommendations for employer gatherings or a date. It’s very hard to go wrong with their menu, most things are very good.

* **Loloan Lobby Bar**: Really good south asian food (Indonesia, Singapore, etc). Authentic food, but fancier. Definitely a good candidate for a dressed-up meal, where a dress shirt and casual black dress doesn’t stand out - but going in just a t-shirt and jeans is also common. It’s quite the interesting dynamic there. Definitely get a cocktail.

* **Quik Sandwiches**: in Uptown it's faster food and a little pricey but really great

* **Watami**: sushi, newly re-opening in Uptown, used to be good before they closed

* **Lou Dawg's** - In Uptown Waterloo, Southern BBQ place. Try the "Big Dawg Beef Crunch Wrap".

# Kitchener

* **East African Cafe:** Good Ethiopian food - decent portions and price, 

* **Muya Restaurant:** Well-flavoured Ethiopian food.

* **Guanaquita:** Hidden upstairs, a Salvadoran option.

* **Philly Cheesesteak**: Really good philly cheesesteak sandwiches in downtown Kitchener. Decently priced and the owner of the restaurant is very friendly!

* **Kinkaku**: AYCE sushi, very popular, limited seating but fantastic food. They take reservations for groups of 6 or more. 

* **Mark’s Caribbean Kitchen**: Great new Caribbean place that just opened. Very friendly staff and the chef will even sometimes come talk to you. Recommend the Jerk Chicken or the Oxtail Stew!

* **Lancaster Smokehouse**: Great Southern BBQ. Try their platters (with friends).

# Other Food

* [**Schmuck Truck**](http://www.schmuckngourmet.ca/): Food truck with generous portions and the best fries I've ever had

* [**bo de's**](http://www.bodefoods.com/): Discount cookies and candy on Northfield. Sells cookies in 5 pound boxes for $10.

* [**Ambrosia Pastry**](https://ambrosiapastry.com): Only open Saturday 10-3, posts weekly menus the night before on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ambrosia_Pastry). Amazing croissants and ice cream.
    * Open Thursday nights in the summer; 2 food trucks come by (date idea anyone?)
