# Around Waterloo

* Use [WatIsRain](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucky.watisrain&hl=en_CA) to navigate the messy and sometimes nonsensical tunnel/bridge system on campus. 

    * There’s a couple of tunnels connecting Arts Lecture Hall, South Campus Hall, the Tatham Centre, and the Environment buildings (saviour in the winter!)

    * Similarly, there’s a bunch of bridges/tunnels connecting the Math/Engineering/Science buildings. For example, you can get from M3 to DWE without going outside.

* If you plan on biking, get a good u-lock and park your bike in a visible area.

    * Bike Centre (SLC) also rents bikes for $100/term during Spring and Fall

* If you want to do a trip further out in the area, you likely need to rent a car:

    * [**Avis car rental (Weber/Union)**](https://goo.gl/maps/c9YgjucBcDE2)**:** No underage fees if you show your Watcard, which saves a whole lot of money especially if your credit card provides CDW insurance (check your cardholder agreement).

    * [**Zipcar**](https://www.zipcar.ca/universities/university-of-waterloo): The area around campus has a few Zipcars for rent. It’s rented on a hourly basis and gas is free. There’s a really good deal on weekday evenings from 6pm to 8am for a ~ $30 flat fare. Sign up is $20 with the student discount.

    * [**Enterprise Car Share**](https://www.enterprisecarshare.ca/ca/en/programs/university/uwaterloo.html)**: **First year’s fee is $1 - there are a couple cars to the North/East of campus.

# Getting to other cities

* **Toronto**: Needs no introduction. ~2h from KW, worth it for day/weekend trips.

    * Weekdays: Take the GO 30 from Charles St Terminal and transfer to a Kitchener GO train, or the rush hour Kitchener-Toronto trains to Union Station in downtown Toronto

    * Friday/Weekends: 

        * **GO:** Take the 25 (preferably the express 25C) to Square One, transfer to the 21 at Square One. 

        * **Greyhound**: from BMH (listed as Waterloo University on their website, to Toronto Bus Station). 

        * **FedBus**: Feds runs a service to locations in the GTA and back. More information on [their website](https://fedbus.feds.ca/), advance ticket purchases required.

    * Anytime: [UW Rideshare FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/225049564330328/) (~ $15 for a one way trip). Also a great way to meet people.

* **Cambridge**: You can ride there free on the GRT on the 200. Nice place to shop. Also nice for walking along the Grand River

* **Stratford**: Nice picturesque downtown with a strong theatre presence and shows all summer.

    * ~30 min drive from KW, or VIA rail from Kitchener GO (runs 2x a day on weekends, works out well for a day trip)
