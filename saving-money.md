<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Saving Money -->

* [Request a GO Student ID](https://studentid.gotransit.com/Metrolinx.StudentIDRequest/en/studentid/Home/IDRequest) and bring this + your PRESTO card to Turnkey to get discounts on GO

* Get Amazon Prime as a student for free for 6 months with your university email. Keep making new outlook aliases, and use those for subsequent accounts to get prime free as long as you are a student.

* Don’t buy textbooks (at least until after the first lecture): there are course/lecture notes/slides for almost every course and they are probably more useful than the textbook in most cases.

    * Most textbooks can be e-rented from the library or acquired online from stores or other sources

    * Academic Clubs and societies usually have textbook libraries (Mathsoc for sure)

* EngSoc has deals for Engineering students - get a sticker from the EngSoc office

* There’s a nice list of deals for students [here](https://globalnews.ca/news/3710211/student-discounts-2017/).
