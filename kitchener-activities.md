<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Kitchener Activities -->

* **[Grand River Rocks**](http://grandriverrocks.com/ ): Rock climbing - bouldering, top rope, lead. This is a gem as this place is cheaper than most rock climbing gyms Iâ€™ve been to.

* **[SkyZone**](https://www.skyzone.com/ca-kitchener): Trampolining, trampoline dodgeball, etc. 

* **[Adventure Rooms**](http://adventurerooms.ca/team-building/): Escape Room 

* **Victoria Park**: Great place to take a walk, or rent out a little boat at the boathouse
